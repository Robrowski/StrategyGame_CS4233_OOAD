To add Interceptors to the server implementation, do the following

0.) Make an interceptor that follows either StrategyMessageInterceptor or StrategyPreprocessorInterceptor

1.) Add the YOURINTERCEPTOR.java file to the interceptors folder

2.) Add the class BINARY to the appropriate file -  MessageProcessingInterceptors.txt or PreprocessingInterceptors.txt
Binaries are in the following form
	package.package.package.class     <- don't use folder names, don't use "./", don't use quotes, don't put .java at the end





TO use this new interceptor
- If it is a preprocessor it will be used automatically for everymessage

- If it is a new version of the message interceptors....
 	you can can instantiate a new "BasicClient" and call
 	aBasicClient.sendAMessage(new GenericMessage("name of your service", (Object[]) args);
 	- make sure "name of your service" is what you put in your interceptor
 	- args can be null if you don't want to send more information
